VirtualClockTower
=================

This little program is a virtual clock tower that you run on your computer. It simulates a real clock tower by gonging on the hour and playing a little jingle every 15 minutes. It has support for customizing your wav files for the bell sounds if you like, and even offers a night mode, which disables the clock after 22:00 and before 8:00. 

## dependancies 

The dependencies are as follows.

1. python 2.7. I am using 2.7.9 here. and 3.x may be supported but I havn't tested it. http://www.python.org
2. pyaudio 0.2.8 for python 2.7. http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/


## instructions

To run this program you simply go to the source directory and run pythonw bell_tower.pyw
If you like, you can set this to start when your computer starts up.

## Future

In the future I would like to add a simple gui.
